# Arduino-vehicle
This repository stores the C code for two Arduino projects

The first project is a Automatic Avoidance Vehicle completed in Janurary 2016. The vehicle has two ultra-sonic sensors for distance detection. One sensor is in the front while the other one is on the right. When the distance in the front is less than the boundary value, the vehicle will check the situation on the right. If there is no obstacle on the right, the car will turn right, otherwise it turns left. 

The second project is a Bluetooth remote control vehicle completed in September 2016. The vehicle uses a Bluetooth module to receive signals from a mobile device. Any cellphone with a Bluetooth serial manager software installed can control the vehicle.
